# Website for rehabilitation clinic

Originally it was my 1st milestone project done during study software development/full stack web development in [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

While studying, my schedule was very tight and I didn't do everything according to my ideas. Now that I have more free time, I decided to go back to my projects and do them according to my vision.

The project is a website for a physiotherapy clinic.

## UX
### User stories

#### Clinic owner: 
I would like to be visible on the internet so that more people could reach me. I want to make people realize that they do not have to live with pain and I am here to help them.

#### Clinic patient: 
When I visit the website I would like to see that this is the place where I can find help for my ailments. I want the power to quickly find an address and a method of contact. It is important to me whether my problem will be solved, what the therapy looks like and what the prices are.
### Strategy

It is a going to be company/ therapist website for local city clients. The main goal of the web is to raise number of patients. They are the local people with back and joint injuries. Audience are mostly the people in age 30-60 from different culture, they do different jobs, but many often time is a sitting position job - drivers, office people. They are suffering for back, spin and muscles pains, but also people with posture defects. Audience are looking for therapy, they want to know what treatments are in the clinic, they want to see good references about. It is important for users to know how to found clinic and how to make a visit.

My goal in design is to make an minimalist, modern and user-friendly website. 

Project goal is to create a first page for rehabilitation clinic which could be presented to the client for approval.

### Scope
Based on the user stories i describe few points of what information needs to be visible on the webpage:

2.  Address and phone number.
